Our X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are “Hell Rated” – upgraded from our Heavy Duty Line to handle the harshest terrains for racing in Desert, Sand, Mud, Rock and Short Courses. Demon X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are our strongest axles to date. 

Through years of research and development Demon Powersports has developed a RACE READY, ULTIMATE PERFORMANCE axle that doesn’t burn a hole in your pocket and adheres to the highest quality standards. The success behind our products stems from thorough quality control. Our products go through extensive and extreme testing and R&D before launching.? 

Entire Axle Made Up of 4340 Chromoly Steel Material (In-and-Out) 

These axles are bigger, beefier, and stronger. Demon X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are built using larger CV joints and shafts, paired with our proprietary dual heat treatment process, and 4340 Chromoly Steel material for all its components including the shaft, housing, cage, race, and balls.  

This gives the axles the edge it needs for superior strength and longevity. We re-engineered our cage design to enhance durability and use Molybdenum grease to lubricate the internal components. The axle's inner components are micro-polished, so the CVs don't heat up like other products.  

4340 chromoly steel is more elastic meaning the axle shaft and its components will absorb any stress and keeps it within itself, eliminating any stress from being transferred into the differential and through your drivetrain. This helps preserve other components on the car! 

Available for Long Travel Kits 

Our X-Treme Heavy Duty are also tailored made to work with all major Long Travel Suspension Kits & Lift Kits. We understand the requirment for the desert and dunes. As provide an out of the box solution since they are already optimized for heat so your CVs can run cooler and last longer.

Our X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are “Hell Rated” – upgraded from our Heavy Duty Line to handle the harshest terrains for racing in Desert, Sand, Mud, Rock and Short Courses. Demon X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are our strongest axles to date. 

Through years of research and development Demon Powersports has developed a RACE READY, ULTIMATE PERFORMANCE axle that doesn’t burn a hole in your pocket and adheres to the highest quality standards. The success behind our products stems from thorough quality control. Our products go through extensive and extreme testing and R&D before launching.? 

Entire Axle Made Up of 4340 Chromoly Steel Material (In-and-Out) 

These axles are bigger, beefier, and stronger. Demon X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are built using larger CV joints and shafts, paired with our proprietary dual heat treatment process, and 4340 Chromoly Steel material for all its components including the shaft, housing, cage, race, and balls.  

This gives the axles the edge it needs for superior strength and longevity. We re-engineered our cage design to enhance durability and use Molybdenum grease to lubricate the internal components. The axle's inner components are micro-polished, so the CVs don't heat up like other products.  

4340 chromoly steel is more elastic meaning the axle shaft and its components will absorb any stress and keeps it within itself, eliminating any stress from being transferred into the differential and through your drivetrain. This helps preserve other components on the car!

These axles are bigger, beefier, and stronger. Demon X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are built using larger CV joints and shafts, paired with our proprietary dual heat treatment process, and 4340 Chromoly Steel material for all its components including the shaft, housing, cage, race, and balls.  

This gives the axles the edge it needs for superior strength and longevity. We re-engineered our cage design to enhance durability and use Molybdenum grease to lubricate the internal components. The axle's inner components are micro-polished, so the CVs don't heat up like other products.  

4340 chromoly steel is more elastic meaning the axle shaft and its components will absorb any stress and keeps it within itself, eliminating any stress from being transferred into the differential and through your drivetrain. This helps preserve other components on the car! 

Available for Long Travel Kits 

Our X-Treme Heavy Duty are also tailored made to work with all major Long Travel Suspension Kits & Lift Kits. We understand the requirment for the desert and dunes. As provide an out of the box solution since they are already optimized for heat so your CVs can run cooler and last longer.

4340 chromoly steel is more elastic meaning the axle shaft and its components will absorb any stress and keeps it within itself, eliminating any stress from being transferred into the differential and through your drivetrain. This helps preserve other components on the car! 

Available for Long Travel Kits 

Our X-Treme Heavy Duty are also tailored made to work with all major Long Travel Suspension Kits & Lift Kits. We understand the requirment for the desert and dunes. As provide an out of the box solution since they are already optimized for heat so your CVs can run cooler and last longer.

Our X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are “Hell Rated” – upgraded from our Heavy Duty Line to handle the harshest terrains for racing in Desert, Sand, Mud, Rock and Short Courses. Demon X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are our strongest axles to date. 

Through years of research and development Demon Powersports has developed a RACE READY, ULTIMATE PERFORMANCE axle that doesn’t burn a hole in your pocket and adheres to the highest quality standards. The success behind our products stems from thorough quality control. Our products go through extensive and extreme testing and R&D before launching.? 

Entire Axle Made Up of 4340 Chromoly Steel Material (In-and-Out) 

These axles are bigger, beefier, and stronger. Demon X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are built using larger CV joints and shafts, paired with our proprietary dual heat treatment process, and 4340 Chromoly Steel material for all its components including the shaft, housing, cage, race, and balls.  

This gives the axles the edge it needs for superior strength and longevity. We re-engineered our cage design to enhance durability and use Molybdenum grease to lubricate the internal components. The axle's inner components are micro-polished, so the CVs don't heat up like other products.  

4340 chromoly steel is more elastic meaning the axle shaft and its components will absorb any stress and keeps it within itself, eliminating any stress from being transferred into the differential and through your drivetrain. This helps preserve other components on the car!

Our X-Treme Heavy Duty are also tailored made to work with all major Long Travel Suspension Kits & Lift Kits. We understand the requirment for the desert and dunes. As provide an out of the box solution since they are already optimized for heat so your CVs can run cooler and last longer.

Entire Axle Made Up of 4340 Chromoly Steel Material (In-and-Out) 

These axles are bigger, beefier, and stronger. Demon X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are built using larger CV joints and shafts, paired with our proprietary dual heat treatment process, and 4340 Chromoly Steel material for all its components including the shaft, housing, cage, race, and balls.  

This gives the axles the edge it needs for superior strength and longevity. We re-engineered our cage design to enhance durability and use Molybdenum grease to lubricate the internal components. The axle's inner components are micro-polished, so the CVs don't heat up like other products.  

4340 chromoly steel is more elastic meaning the axle shaft and its components will absorb any stress and keeps it within itself, eliminating any stress from being transferred into the differential and through your drivetrain. This helps preserve other components on the car!

This gives the axles the edge it needs for superior strength and longevity. We re-engineered our cage design to enhance durability and use Molybdenum grease to lubricate the internal components. The axle's inner components are micro-polished, so the CVs don't heat up like other products.

Vanadium, a common element in high-speed tool steel (HSS), plays a crucial role in elevating the steel's strength to unparalleled levels. This means our 300M axles are built to withstand even the most demanding conditions, ensuring maximum durability and longevity. The increased Silicon content further enhances the steel's strength and hardness, while also providing superior resistance to high-temperature oxidation. This means you can count on our 300M axles to perform flawlessly, even in the harshest environments.",Demon Powersports,,Xtreme Heavy Duty Axle Race Spec 300M,,TRUE,Title,Default Title,,,,,,,,PAXL-8019XHD-R,0,shopify,5,deny,manual,549,549,TRUE,TRUE,8.40844E+11,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/8399/5245/files/PAXL-8019XHD-C.jpg,1,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,active

Our X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are “Hell Rated” – upgraded from our Heavy Duty Line to handle the harshest terrains for racing in Desert, Sand, Mud, Rock and Short Courses. Demon X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are our strongest axles to date. 

Through years of research and development Demon Powersports has developed a RACE READY, ULTIMATE PERFORMANCE axle that doesn’t burn a hole in your pocket and adheres to the highest quality standards. The success behind our products stems from thorough quality control. Our products go through extensive and extreme testing and R&D before launching.? 

Entire Axle Made Up of 4340 Chromoly Steel Material (In-and-Out) 

These axles are bigger, beefier, and stronger. Demon X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are built using larger CV joints and shafts, paired with our proprietary dual heat treatment process, and 4340 Chromoly Steel material for all its components including the shaft, housing, cage, race, and balls.  

This gives the axles the edge it needs for superior strength and longevity. We re-engineered our cage design to enhance durability and use Molybdenum grease to lubricate the internal components. The axle's inner components are micro-polished, so the CVs don't heat up like other products.  

4340 chromoly steel is more elastic meaning the axle shaft and its components will absorb any stress and keeps it within itself, eliminating any stress from being transferred into the differential and through your drivetrain. This helps preserve other components on the car! 

Available for Long Travel Kits 

Our X-Treme Heavy Duty are also tailored made to work with all major Long Travel Suspension Kits & Lift Kits. We understand the requirment for the desert and dunes. As provide an out of the box solution since they are already optimized for heat so your CVs can run cooler and last longer.

Our X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are “Hell Rated” – upgraded from our Heavy Duty Line to handle the harshest terrains for racing in Desert, Sand, Mud, Rock and Short Courses. Demon X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are our strongest axles to date. 

Through years of research and development Demon Powersports has developed a RACE READY, ULTIMATE PERFORMANCE axle that doesn’t burn a hole in your pocket and adheres to the highest quality standards. The success behind our products stems from thorough quality control. Our products go through extensive and extreme testing and R&D before launching.? 

Entire Axle Made Up of 4340 Chromoly Steel Material (In-and-Out) 

These axles are bigger, beefier, and stronger. Demon X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are built using larger CV joints and shafts, paired with our proprietary dual heat treatment process, and 4340 Chromoly Steel material for all its components including the shaft, housing, cage, race, and balls.  

This gives the axles the edge it needs for superior strength and longevity. We re-engineered our cage design to enhance durability and use Molybdenum grease to lubricate the internal components. The axle's inner components are micro-polished, so the CVs don't heat up like other products.  

4340 chromoly steel is more elastic meaning the axle shaft and its components will absorb any stress and keeps it within itself, eliminating any stress from being transferred into the differential and through your drivetrain. This helps preserve other components on the car!

Our X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are “Hell Rated” – upgraded from our Heavy Duty Line to handle the harshest terrains for racing in Desert, Sand, Mud, Rock and Short Courses. Demon X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are our strongest axles to date. 

Through years of research and development Demon Powersports has developed a RACE READY, ULTIMATE PERFORMANCE axle that doesn’t burn a hole in your pocket and adheres to the highest quality standards. The success behind our products stems from thorough quality control. Our products go through extensive and extreme testing and R&D before launching.? 

Entire Axle Made Up of 4340 Chromoly Steel Material (In-and-Out) 

These axles are bigger, beefier, and stronger. Demon X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are built using larger CV joints and shafts, paired with our proprietary dual heat treatment process, and 4340 Chromoly Steel material for all its components including the shaft, housing, cage, race, and balls.  

This gives the axles the edge it needs for superior strength and longevity. We re-engineered our cage design to enhance durability and use Molybdenum grease to lubricate the internal components. The axle's inner components are micro-polished, so the CVs don't heat up like other products.  

4340 chromoly steel is more elastic meaning the axle shaft and its components will absorb any stress and keeps it within itself, eliminating any stress from being transferred into the differential and through your drivetrain. This helps preserve other components on the car! 

Available for Long Travel Kits 

Our X-Treme Heavy Duty are also tailored made to work with all major Long Travel Suspension Kits & Lift Kits. We understand the requirment for the desert and dunes. As provide an out of the box solution since they are already optimized for heat so your CVs can run cooler and last longer.  If you don’t believe us talk to any one of our racers in BITD, SCORE, SNORA, DAKHAR etc whom trust and use our products!

Through years of research and development Demon Powersports has developed a RACE READY, ULTIMATE PERFORMANCE axle that doesn’t burn a hole in your pocket and adheres to the highest quality standards. The success behind our products stems from thorough quality control. Our products go through extensive and extreme testing and R&D before launching.?

This gives the axles the edge it needs for superior strength and longevity. We re-engineered our cage design to enhance durability and use Molybdenum grease to lubricate the internal components. The axle's inner components are micro-polished, so the CVs don't heat up like other products.  

4340 chromoly steel is more elastic meaning the axle shaft and its components will absorb any stress and keeps it within itself, eliminating any stress from being transferred into the differential and through your drivetrain. This helps preserve other components on the car!

Entire Axle Made Up of 4340 Chromoly Steel Material (In-and-Out) 

These axles are bigger, beefier, and stronger. Demon X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are built using larger CV joints and shafts, paired with our proprietary dual heat treatment process, and 4340 Chromoly Steel material for all its components including the shaft, housing, cage, race, and balls.  

This gives the axles the edge it needs for superior strength and longevity. We re-engineered our cage design to enhance durability and use Molybdenum grease to lubricate the internal components. The axle's inner components are micro-polished, so the CVs don't heat up like other products.

Our X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are “Hell Rated” – upgraded from our Heavy Duty Line to handle the harshest terrains for racing in Desert, Sand, Mud, Rock and Short Courses. Demon X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are our strongest axles to date. 
Through years of research and development Demon Powersports has developed a RACE READY, ULTIMATE PERFORMANCE axle that doesn’t burn a hole in your pocket and adheres to the highest quality standards. The success behind our products stems from thorough quality control. Our products go through extensive and extreme testing and R&D before launching.? 
Entire Axle Made Up of 4340 Chromoly Steel Material (In-and-Out) 
These axles are bigger, beefier, and stronger. Demon X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are built using larger CV joints and shafts, paired with our proprietary dual heat treatment process, and 4340 Chromoly Steel material for all its components including the shaft, housing, cage, race, and balls.  
This gives the axles the edge it needs for superior strength and longevity. We re-engineered our cage design to enhance durability and use Molybdenum grease to lubricate the internal components. The axle's inner components are micro-polished, so the CVs don't heat up like other products.  
4340 chromoly steel is more elastic meaning the axle shaft and its components will absorb any stress and keeps it within itself, eliminating any stress from being transferred into the differential and through your drivetrain. This helps preserve other components on the car! 
Available for Long Travel Kits 
Our X-Treme Heavy Duty are also tailored made to work with all major Long Travel Suspension Kits & Lift Kits. We understand the requirment for the desert and dunes. As provide an out of the box solution since they are already optimized for heat so your CVs can run cooler and last longer.

Entire Axle Made Up of 4340 Chromoly Steel Material (In-and-Out) 

These axles are bigger, beefier, and stronger. Demon X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are built using larger CV joints and shafts, paired with our proprietary dual heat treatment process, and 4340 Chromoly Steel material for all its components including the shaft, housing, cage, race, and balls.  

This gives the axles the edge it needs for superior strength and longevity. We re-engineered our cage design to enhance durability and use Molybdenum grease to lubricate the internal components. The axle's inner components are micro-polished, so the CVs don't heat up like other products.  

4340 chromoly steel is more elastic meaning the axle shaft and its components will absorb any stress and keeps it within itself, eliminating any stress from being transferred into the differential and through your drivetrain. This helps preserve other components on the car!

Our X-Treme Heavy Duty are also tailored made to work with all major Long Travel Suspension Kits & Lift Kits. We understand the requirment for the desert and dunes.

Our X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are “Hell Rated” – upgraded from our Heavy Duty Line to handle the harshest terrains for racing in Desert, Sand, Mud, Rock and Short Courses. Demon X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are our strongest axles to date. 

Through years of research and development Demon Powersports has developed a RACE READY, ULTIMATE PERFORMANCE axle that doesn’t burn a hole in your pocket and adheres to the highest quality standards. The success behind our products stems from thorough quality control. Our products go through extensive and extreme testing and R&D before launching.? 

Entire Axle Made Up of 4340 Chromoly Steel Material (In-and-Out) 

These axles are bigger, beefier, and stronger. Demon X-Treme Heavy Duty Axles are built using larger CV joints and shafts, paired with our proprietary dual heat treatment process, and 4340 Chromoly Steel material for all its components including the shaft, housing, cage, race, and balls.  

This gives the axles the edge it needs for superior strength and longevity. We re-engineered our cage design to enhance durability and use Molybdenum grease to lubricate the internal components. The axle's inner components are micro-polished, so the CVs don't heat up like other products.  

4340 chromoly steel is more elastic meaning the axle shaft and its components will absorb any stress and keeps it within itself, eliminating any stress from being transferred into the differential and through your drivetrain. This helps preserve other components on the car! 

Available for Long Travel Kits 

Our X-Treme Heavy Duty are also tailored made to work with all major Long Travel Suspension Kits & Lift Kits. We understand the requirment for the desert and dunes. As provide an out of the box solution since they are already optimized for heat so your CVs can run cooler and last longer.  If you don’t believe us talk to any one of our racers in BITD, SCORE, SNORA, DAKHAR etc whom trust and use our products! 

Our long travel axles are tailor made to fit the following suspension kits Cognito Motorsports, Extreme Performance, Fireball Racing HCR, NXS Designs, Madigan Motorsports, SF Raceworks, LSK, Lone Star Racing, Fifty6 Industries, FabWerx, Grounder 4, UTV Wolfpack, Reflex, Long Travel Industries and much more!!
