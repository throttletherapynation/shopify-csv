Arctic Cat Prowler Custom Cage,arctic-cat-prowler-custom-cage,"The Axle & Arc Fab cage for the Arctic Cat Prowler platform brings the perfect combination of strength, clean lines, and rider-built design. Whether you ride tight woods, rocky climbs, dunes, or high-speed open terrain, this cage is engineered to deliver real protection, real fitment, and the kind of craftsmanship that only comes from a team that rides the same way you do.

Every cage starts with raw DOM steel, precision-cut and mandrel-bent for accuracy and consistency across every machine. The fitment is tight, the lines are clean, and the geometry is designed to build confidence on every ride.

AVAILABLE BUILD TIERS

TRAIL SERIES CAGE (Build 1)
Our clean, stronger-than-stock upgrade. Simple, durable, and designed for everyday riders who want better protection and better style than OEM.

REINFORCED SERIES CAGE (Build 2)
Enhanced triangulation, added bracing, and reinforced structure offer superior rollover strength. A perfect middle-ground for aggressive recreational riders.

PRO SERIES CAGE (Build 3)

STANDARD FINISH: RAW STEEL
All cages are delivered in raw steel so you can choose your own powder coat or custom finish. Powder coat and coating for add-ons are available separately through Axle & Arc Fab’s customization menu.

OPTIONAL ADD-ONS

Whether you ride tight woods, rocky climbs, dunes, or high-speed open terrain, this cage is engineered to deliver real protection, real fitment, and the kind of craftsmanship that only comes from a team that rides the same way you do.

Every cage starts with raw DOM steel, precision-cut and mandrel-bent for accuracy and consistency across every machine. The fitment is tight, the lines are clean, and the geometry is designed to build confidence on every ride.

AVAILABLE BUILD TIERS

Our clean, stronger-than-stock upgrade. Simple, durable, and designed for everyday riders who want better protection and better style than OEM.

REINFORCED SERIES CAGE (Build 2)

Kawasaki Teryx Custom Cage,kawasaki-teryx-custom-cage,"The Axle & Arc Fab cage for the Kawasaki Teryx platform brings the perfect combination of strength, clean lines, and rider-built design.

Every cage starts with raw DOM steel, precision-cut and mandrel-bent for accuracy and consistency across every machine. The fitment is tight, the lines are clean, and the geometry is designed to build confidence on every ride.

Maximum strength, premium structure, and competition-inspired tubing layout. Built for riders who push limits and want the strongest configuration available for the Yamaha YXZ1000R SS/SS XT-R platform.

STANDARD FINISH: RAW STEEL
All cages are delivered in raw steel so you can choose your own powder coat or custom finish. Powder coat and coating for add-ons are available separately through Axle & Arc Fab’s customization menu.

OPTIONAL ADD-ONS
Your Yamaha YXZ1000R SS/SS XT-R cage can be customized further with our full Axle & Arc Fab lineup of roofs, doors, intrusion bars, tube beds, trunk systems, roof racks, grab handles, windshield frames, safety upgrades, audio mounts, storage solutions, and more.

Your machine. Your build. Your therapy. Every Axle & Arc Fab cage is built for riders who expect more from their machine — and the people who build it.
